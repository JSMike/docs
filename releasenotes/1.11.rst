User Agent Support
==================

The following user agents have been tested and are supported in this release. If a user agent version is not listed as
supported, it still may work, especially on browsers with rapid release cycles (Chrome, Firefox). Future minor releases
of Dojo might include fixes to support future releases of these browsers, but it is not guaranteed.

* Firefox 3.6-29

* Safari 5-7

* Chrome 13-35
