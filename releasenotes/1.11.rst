User Agent Support
==================

The following user agents have been tested and are supported in this release. If a user agent version is not listed as
supported, it still may work, especially on browsers with rapid release cycles (Chrome, Firefox). Future minor releases
of Dojo might include fixes to support future releases of these browsers, but it is not guaranteed.

**Desktop**

* Firefox 3.6-32

* Safari 6-8

* Chrome 13-37

* IE 8-11

* Opera 10.50-12 (Dojo core only). Blink-based versions of Opera should work like Chrome, but are not officially tested or supported for this release.

**Mobile (dojox/mobile)**

* iOS (Mobile Safari), 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x (including all Dijit widgets except Editor)

* Android 2.3, 4.0-4.4 (Platform browser and Chrome browser) (including all Dijit widgets for Android 4.0-4.4 except Editor)

* BlackBerry 6-7 & 10 (Platform browser)

* Windows Phone 8 (IE10)

* Mobile compatibility on desktop browsers: IE 8-11, Firefox 4-32, Chrome 13-37


**Server-Side User Agents**

* Node 0.8.X, 0.10.X

Dojo Core
=========

dojo/on
-------

Added selectorTarget property from on.selector as property of event object, https://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/18355


Dijit
=====




DojoX
=====

dtl
---

* Enable looping over objects with {% for key, value in object %}, https://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/17251 . This will break existing templates that treats objects as array of values (ie discarding keys).


form
----

* BusyButton, BusyDropDownButton, and BusyComboButton refactored so they can be loaded over AMD.


layout
------

* Fixed `dojox/layout/GridContainerLite` to work in apps using more than one instance or version of Dojo.


mdnd
----

* Fixed to work in apps using more than one instance or version of Dojo.


Store
-----

* A new dojox/store/OData store has been added.


Util
====


Demos
=====

Migration Notes
===============

* If using `dojox/dtl`, the change to looping may impact you.
* BusyDropDownButton and BusyComboButton were split into separate files, so they need to be required explicitly,
rather than just loading dojox/form/BusyButton.
