User Agent Support
==================

The following user agents have been tested and are supported in this release. If a user agent version is not listed as 
supported, it still may work, especially on browsers with rapid release cycles (Chrome, Firefox). Future minor releases
of Dojo might include fixes to support future releases of these browsers, but it is not guaranteed.

Also please note that even if IE6 and 7 code paths have not been removed, Dojo 1.10 is removing official support for
those browsers.

* Firefox 3.6-25

* Safari 5-6

Dojo Core
=========

Dijit
=====

Dialog
------
Added support for Dialog.resize(dimensions).  Previously it ignored the dimensions parameter.
This means that Dialog now works with dojox/layout/ResizeHandle.
Note though that you still cannot specify an initial size on the dialog.

DojoX
=====

Util
====

**Builder**

Added support for uglify-js 2.x builder. To use uglify-js 2.x, just upgrade from 1.x. If optimizeOptions is used, some of the options may need to be changed to match uglify-js 2.x naming, see `Uglilfy 2 documentation <https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2>`_ on the new options available.

In addition, multiple processes will be used while running uglify builder. In previous versions, only one CPU core is being used.
