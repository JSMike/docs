User Agent Support

The following user agents have been tested and are supported in this release. If a user agent version is not listed as

of Dojo might include fixes to support future releases of these browsers, but it is not guaranteed.

Dojo Core
=========

Dijit
=====

Dialog
------
Added support for Dialog.resize(dimensions).  Previously it ignored the dimensions parameter.
This means that Dialog now works with dojox/layout/ResizeHandle.
Note though that you still cannot specify an initial size on the dialog.

Charting
--------
 * Series can now be hidden without removing them
 * SelectableLegend leverages this new feature to provide consistent approach to series visibility switch across the various plots


Gfx
---

DojoX
=====

Util
====

**Builder**

Added support for uglify-js 2.x builder. To use uglify-js 2.x, just upgrade from 1.x. If optimizeOptions is used, some of the options may need to be changed to match uglify-js 2.x naming, see `Uglilfy 2 documentation <https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2>`_ on the new options available.

In addition, multiple processes will be used while running uglify builder. In previous versions, only one CPU core is being used.
